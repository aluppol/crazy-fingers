# Crazy Fingers

When You buy a new keyboard or you are just starting to work with a laptop it’s good to make your fingers use to keyboard. I used “solo for keyboard” when I was at the university that I had to install on my laptop. This app serves just the same purpose, only its web. You can increase your typing speed with this app and become more comfortable with your keyboard.
